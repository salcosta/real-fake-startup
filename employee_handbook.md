# Employee Handbook

By participating in Real Fake Startup you agree to abide by the policies set forth
in this document.

Real Fake Startup is not an actual company but we will try to simulate the experience 
as closely as possible. Particpants are encourage to act professionally throughout 
the duration of the program.

As this is not a real company you may leave at any time but please try to consider
the impact this will have on your group.

Like a real company you can be terminated or asked to leave the program. This may
happen if you fail to participate or if you violate the code of conduct.

It is unlikely you will be asked to leave due to inability to complete the work
but if this is the case we will try to point you towards training that will
help you acquire the skills needed and then you may re-enter the program again
in the future.
